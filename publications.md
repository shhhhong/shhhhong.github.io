  NaI:Tl,6Li bulk crystals are regarded as promising neutron-gamma (n-γ) scintillators because of low production cost and superior n-γ pulse shape discrimination (PSD) performance. In this work, some rare earth elements (Gd, Y, Lu and Sc) co-doped NaI:Tl,6Li single crystals were grown by the multi-ampoule Bridgman method. It was found that the rare earth co-doping significantly improves the pulse height discrimination (PHD) capability of NaI:Tl,6Li with high alpha/beta (α/β) ratio, approaching to 100%. The optimal α/β ratios achieved for Gd, Y, Lu and Sc co-doped NaI:Tl,6Li are 0.85, 0.93, 0.95, and 0.83, respectively.Electron equivalent energy per neutron interaction is above 3.96 MeV and can be as high as 4.54 MeV, close to the Q value of 4.78 MeV for 6Li(n,α)3H interaction. Moreover, the rare earth co-doped NaI:Tl,6Li crystals still maintain the superior PSD capability with figure of merit (FoM) in the range of 2.1–3.3. These results highlight the great potential of rare-earth co-doped NaI:Tl,6Li crystals serving as high-performance n-γ scintillators.
