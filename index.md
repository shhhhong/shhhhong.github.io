# About Me

<img src="https://shhhhong.github.io/images/own1.JPG" class="floatpic">

Here is **Zhihao Song**.<br>

I received my master’s degree in Microelectronics and Solid Electronics from Shanghai University, where I conducted my research at the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SICCAS) under the supervision of Prof. Yuntao Wu. My studies focused on radiation–matter interaction and functional materials, studying how energetic excitation in solids is converted into detectable light through both experimental and computational approaches.

Through this experience, I developed a systems-level perspective on materials research — connecting light–matter interaction, energy conversion, and detection processes into a coherent understanding of how materials behave under optical and energetic excitation. I combined crystal processing, materials characterization, experimental observation, modeling, and data analysis to bridge underlying physics with material properties and detector performance.

Looking ahead, I aim to integrate materials research with experiments, computation, and code-based modeling to accelerate the discovery of efficient and reliable functional materials. I’m broadly interested in frameworks that link physical insight, experiments, simulations, and data to guide the design of advanced materials across diverse energy and detection applications.
