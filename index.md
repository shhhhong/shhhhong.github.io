# About Me

<img src="https://shhhhong.github.io/images/own1.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Zhihao Song (宋植昊)**.<br>


I am a researcher trained at the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SICCAS), where I continue to collaborate on work related to radiation–matter interaction and functional materials. My research broadly focuses on how energetic particles interact with solids to generate optical or electronic responses, linking basic physical processes with the performance of radiation-detection materials.

My experience spans a range of studies on radiation-responsive materials, combining experimental investigation with theoretical and computational analysis. I am particularly interested in how microscopic carrier behavior and defect dynamics influence measurable material properties under high-energy excitation. Through this combined perspective, I aim to connect fundamental understanding with practical design principles for improved detection systems.

I am currently preparing to pursue PhD opportunities that build on this background. In the long term, I hope to bring together materials research, simulation, and data-driven modeling to accelerate the discovery of efficient and reliable materials for future radiation-detection technologies.
