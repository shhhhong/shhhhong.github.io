On weekends and holidays, I enjoy traveling, especially going on city walks. I also like cooking, and I love spending time with my pet parrot. If you like these things too, we can share and chat about them together!

<br>I love wandering aimlessly through the city, slipping into random cafés or restaurants just to let time drift by. It’s the kind of simple thing that brings me peace and quiet happiness.

## Cooking

## My Parrots

I have two adorable cockatiels: Dazhuang, the yellow one who’s strong like The Rock, and Jingang, the gray one — a “King Kong Barbie” with a sweet face and a mighty body. They’re still quite scared of humans — their cage is strictly a “no-human zone.”
