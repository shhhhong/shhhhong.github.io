I enjoy coding and data visualization, love exploring new places through city walks, and cherish time with my pet parrot. If you share any of these interests, let’s chat.

<br>I like turning scattered datasets into clear visuals.
A small script and a clean figure — that’s how I approach academic research as well, making complex data easier to understand.

## City walk

<br>I love wandering aimlessly through the city, slipping into random cafés or restaurants just to let time drift by. It’s the kind of simple thing that brings me peace and quiet happiness.

## My Parrots

I have two adorable cockatiels: Dazhuang, the yellow one who’s strong like The Rock, and Jingang, the gray one — a “King Kong Barbie” with a sweet face and a mighty body. They’re still quite scared of humans — their cage is strictly a “no-human zone.”
